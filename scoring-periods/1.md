## `Scoring Period 1`
### _15/02/21 - 28/02/21_
<br>

_Note: [Scoring Period #0](/0.md) was also created in order to recognize existing contributors to the project._
<br>
#### Announcement
We are very happy to announce the inception of our Founding Member program. This initial scoring period will help us to calibrate the program rules and ensure the system works effectively before marketing the program more widely during `Scoring Period #2`.

Existing contributors to the project should also be aware that during this first scoring period, previous contributions to the project can be reported as part of (`Scoring Period #0`). After `Scoring Period #1` has ended, this will no longer be possible.

We also wanted to recognize our Initial Founding Members, namely:
- `@tomato`
- `@freakstatic`
- `@l1dev`
- `@nexusfallout`
- `@enjoythefood`

We would like to thank these community members for their generous ongoing contributions to the project and hope that they will continue to be excellent ambassadors for Joystream as official Founding Members.


#### Processing Note

_Once we have processed all of the summaries submitted in this period and inducted any new founding members etc., a processing note will be added here with comments and some suggestions for the next scoring period._

_Check back here on `04/03/21` when we expect to have processed all of the qualifying activity summaries._
