## `Scoring Period 0`
### _21/09/20* - 28/02/21_
_*Contributions on-chain (e.g. participating in roles) can be included from when the latest chain was launched, whereas off-chain contributions (e.g. supporting new users in Telegram) can be included since the genesis of the project._

#### Announcement
Alongside our first "official" scoring period ([#1](/1.md)) for the Founding Member Program, we will also be running a special one-off scoring period to compensate existing contributors to the project.

`Intitial Founding Members` (who have already been contacted) will not be able to submit activity summaries as part of Scoring Period #0 as we have already accounted for their previous contributions.

However, if you are not an `Initial Founding Member` but have already made contributions to the project, during the course of Scoring Period #0, simply submit a summary of all of your contributions to the project so far using the instructions [here](../SUBMISSION-GUIDELINES.md) and we will account for this activity with leaderboard points (in the same way as ongoing contributions).


#### Processing Note

_Once we have processed all of the summaries submitted in this period and inducted any additional founding members etc., a processing note will be added here with comments and some suggestions for the next scoring period._

_We will process activity summaries for this scoring period within 14 days of submission. For grading to take place, you must submit your summary before 28/02/21._
